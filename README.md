## Instructions

In order to run this http-server in a Chrome browser in a restricted environment inside a Company, I followed this [link](https://developer.stackblitz.com/platform/webcontainers/browser-config) and disabled all security of the Browser. I know this is not recomended, but this browser is not used for any other purpose.
